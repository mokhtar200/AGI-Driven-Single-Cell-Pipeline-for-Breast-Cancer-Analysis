## Overview

**AGI-Driven Single-Cell Pipeline** is an intelligent, adaptive framework for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data with a focus on breast cancer research. Unlike traditional pipelines with fixed parameters, this system uses artificial general intelligence (AGI) principles to dynamically optimize analysis parameters at each step, resulting in more robust and biologically relevant results.

## Key Features

### Intelligent Decision Making
- **Dynamic Parameter Optimization**: AGI algorithms adapt thresholds based on data characteristics
- **Self-Correcting Analysis**: Automatically detects and adjusts for suboptimal parameters
- **Context-Aware Processing**: Considers biological context (breast cancer-specific optimizations)

### Comprehensive Analysis
- **Automated QC & Filtering**: Intelligent outlier detection and removal
- **Smart Clustering**: Resolution selection based on cluster stability metrics
- **Cell Type Annotation**: Integration of reference-based and unsupervised methods
- **Tumor/Normal Classification**: Machine learning-based epithelial state determination
- **Differential Expression**: Adaptive thresholding for gene discovery

### Visualization & Reporting
- **Automated Plot Generation**: Quality control metrics, UMAPs, heatmaps
- **Interactive Reports**: HTML reports with clickable visualizations
- **Publication-Ready Figures**: High-resolution, customizable plots
